Airline Delays Analysis Project
Project Description
This project aims to analyze flight delay data to understand patterns and underlying causes of delays. Data from multiple airlines and destinations are analyzed to provide comprehensive insights into flight performance.

Data
Dataset was collected From Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giovamata/airlinedelaycauses/data)
The following data were analyzed:
Number of Flights: 1.94 million flights.
Number of Destinations: 304 destinations.
Number of Airlines: 20 airlines.
Data Model
The provided data model outlines the structure and relationships between various entities related to airline operations. Here's a summary of the key components:

Carrier:

Contains information about airlines, including codes (MIA Carrier Code, EOS Carrier Code).
Airport:

Stores details about airports, such as country code, location (latitude, longitude), and region name.
Delayed Flights (Fact Table):

Tracks data related to flight delays, cancellations, and other operational metrics. Key fields include AirTime, DepDelay, CancellationCode, and Distance.
Date:

Manages date-related information, including day, month, year, and specific date keys for temporal analysis.
Measures:

Contains aggregated metrics such as average air time, average carrier delay, and average departure delay.
Time:

Defines time-related units like hour, minute, and specific time periods (e.g., Tuesday, ThursdayPeriod).
